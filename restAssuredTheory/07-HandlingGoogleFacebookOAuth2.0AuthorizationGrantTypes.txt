Introduction to OAuth 2.0 and different grant types:

Testing OAuth 2.0 APIs using Postman and Rest Assured (Automation)

What is OAuth 2.0?
OAuth 2.0 comes with multiple grant types
Authorization code  and client credentials are the most commonly used  grant types for OAuth
Understand the flow of OAuth(Authorization code) grant type with real world example
Backend implementation of Authorization code with different layers of security
Plan for generating access token using APIs in postman for the complex flow of authorization code OAuth 2.0
API testing with generated access token
automate complete OAuth 2.0 flow using rest assured
Shortcut to generate access token for OAuth in Postman
How client credentials grant types are different from automation code grant type


Why Applications rely on other(google or facebook) authentications?
No Data breach headaches for application
Need not maintain user profile data
This also allows richer websites allowing disparate applications to talk to each other



OAuth 2.0 is the industry standard protocol for authorization .OAuth 2.0 focuses on client developer simplicity while
providing specific authorization flows for web applications , desktop applications , mobile phones and living room devices
example : we can see the bookmyshow website , signIn we have with Google , Facebook - this is OAuth 2.0 grant type

Client    		ClientID    			 clientSecretID  					 ResourceOwner	  Resource/Authorization Server
bookmyshow		Id that identifies the client  Bookmyshow registers this with google     Human			Google

bookmyshow registers with google servers and they will get clientid and clientsecretId from google
then any person wants to login to bookmyshow , but thru google then google will send profile data to bookmyshow[password will not be shared]

When we try to login with gmail , we will get unique clientid for each user

Step1: User signin into google by hitting google authorization server and get code
	 application will use this code to hit google resource server in backend to get access token 
	 application grants access to user by validating access token
